   - We provided evidence for a delayed and unsynchronized development of the fronto-limbic system of adolescents with social anxiety disorder. We found significant co-variance in grey matter volume of orbitofrontal gyrus, insula, and amygdala in typically developing adolescents, but this co-variance relationship was disrupted in adolescents with social anxiety disorder.
