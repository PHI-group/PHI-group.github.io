   - In a sample of first-episode drug-naive schizophrenia patients and matched healthy controls, we found that the functional connectivity within the precuneus network (PCN) distinguishes the schizophrenia patients with auditory hallucinations from those without auditory hallucinations and the healthy controls. In contrast, we did not detect a significant inter-group difference in the functional connectivity of the default mode network (DMN). These findings support different roles of PCN and DMN in functional connectivity deficits in schizophrenia.
