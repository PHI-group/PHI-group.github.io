   - We found that inter-subject variability in data impact the performance of temporal-concatenated ICA, a commonly used group-level ICA approach, to estimate the group-level default mode network (DMN).

   - We showed that increased inter-subject variability caused inaccurate estimation of DMN and strong dependence on the number-of-component setting in ICA.   

   - This study calls for caution when applying TC-GICA to datasets expected to have large inter-individual variability, such as pooling different experimental groups of subjects
